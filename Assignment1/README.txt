Hello,

My name is Angela Jaeyeon Petersen (Yoo). I am a part-time grad student at JHU pursuing a degree in ISE. When I am not studying Ruby on Rails for this course, I am at my other jobs, one as a software developer and another as the CEO of the Petersen household. These jobs enhance skillsets such as cooking, singing and running around in circles, all which I thoroughly enjoy, however I am here to enhance my software skills for one of my jobs. 

In our free time, we as a family like to go hiking in the beautiful hills (not mountains) of Seattle with our kiddos, cook multinational food, go wine-tasting and visit the many parks in the area.

I look forward to learning Ruby on Rails!

Angela
